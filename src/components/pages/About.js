            <p>My name is Chuan Wang, I'm a recent graduate from UW Coding Boot Camp. I got my bachelors back in
                2014 in Computer Science from Univeristy of Washington Bothell, however I did not work in the field
                outside of being an teacher assistant and my internship at Digitial Futures Lab at the school.</p>
            <p>There was a lot of personal issues leading to me not being able to puruse my career in software
                developement at the time of my graduation, I've since done some entrepenureship and have experience
                with sales and dealing with vendors and customers.</p>
            <p>I have experience coding with a variety of languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#. I am familiar with use of techs such as REACTjs, NODEjs, handlebars, mongodb, sql, etc.</p>
            <p>I am now once again pursuing a career in the computer sciences and am very excited to get back into
                coding.</p>
